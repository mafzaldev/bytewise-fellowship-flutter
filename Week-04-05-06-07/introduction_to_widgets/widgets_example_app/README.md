# Widgets Example App

In this example, we create a new Timer object in initState() that updates the counter variable every second using setState(). In dispose(), we cancel the timer to prevent memory leaks. The build() method returns a Scaffold widget that contains a Column with a Text widget that displays the current counter value, a RaisedButton widget that resets the counter, and a TextField widget for user input.
