# Week 09-10-11-12 (Clone Application Project)

In this week, we were asked to build a clone of an existing application. I chose to build a clone of the [Instagam](https://www.instagram.com/) application. I chose this application because it is one of the most popular image sharing applications in the world. It is also one of the most used applications in my country, so I thought it would be a good idea to build a clone of it. I also wanted to build a clone of an application that I use on a daily basis, so I could learn more about the application and how it works. I used `Flutter` to build the UI and used `Firebase` to build the backend.

## Features

The following features are implemented in this project:

I stored the source code for this project in a separate repository, which can be found [here](https://github.com/mafzaldev/flutter-instagram)
