# Week 01 (Onboarding)

- To start, the initial meeting that I attended was designed to provide an introduction to the fellowship program that I am participating in. During this meeting, I learned about the various components of the program, including its goals, objectives, and requirements. I was also given an overview of the different stages of the program and what I can expect to learn and achieve throughout each stage.

- As part of the program's requirements, I was asked to provide information about my prior experience with Flutter by filling out a Google form. This form allowed me to give idea of my knowledge and skill level with this particular framework, which will help my mentors and fellow participants better understand my strengths and areas where I may need additional support.

- To further demonstrate my progress and work throughout the program, I set up a GitHub repository. This repository serves as a platform where I can push my daily or weekly assignments, allowing my mentors and fellow participants to review and provide feedback on my work. This also enables me to track my own progress and ensure that I am meeting the program's requirements and goals.

- Finally, I attended another meeting with my mentors and fellow participants to discuss the roadmap and plan for the rest of the fellowship program. During this meeting, we discussed the program's timeline, upcoming milestones, and what we can expect to accomplish in the coming weeks and months. We also had the opportunity to ask questions, share ideas, and provide feedback on the program's structure and content.
