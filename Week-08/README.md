# Week 08 (Feedback)

During week 08, I completed the submission of my assignments from the previous weeks. I had the opportunity to receive feedback from our lead, where I discussed any challenges I had faced up until that point. Additionally, I took the time to discuss our future plans and establish a roadmap for the upcoming weeks.
