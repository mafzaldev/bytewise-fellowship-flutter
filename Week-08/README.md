# Week 08 (Feedback)

During week 08, I completed the submission of my assignments from the previous weeks. We had the opportunity to receive feedback from our lead, where we discussed any challenges we had faced up until that point. Additionally, we took the time to discuss our future plans and establish a roadmap for the upcoming weeks.
