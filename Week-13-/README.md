# Week 13- (75 Hard Flutter App)

In these weeks, we were asked to build any Flutter based application, which should be a complete application with all the features and functionalities. I have built a **75 Hard** application, which is a fitness application. It is a 75 days challenge, where you have to follow a strict diet and workout plan for 75 days. If you miss a single day, you have to start from day 1 again. This application is based on the same concept.

## Features

- User can register and login
- User can see the list of all the challenges
- User can see the details of a particular challenge
- User can keep track of their progress
- User can see the inspirational quotes on the home screen
- User can view their progress history
- User will get a notification to remind them to complete their daily tasks
- User's progress will be saved locally in the device
- User will recieve a notification, when the progress is saved locally(at 11:30PM)
- For reading task, user can see a list of books

I stored the source code for this project in a separate repository, which can be found [here](https://github.com/mafzaldev/flutter-75-hard)
